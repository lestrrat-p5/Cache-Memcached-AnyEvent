Changes
=======

0.00013 - 25 Feb 2010
    * Fix t/100_commands.t -- if (1) you have EV.pm installed, AND (2)
      your memcached server does not understand binary protocol, then
      this test might fail with a segmentation fault. 
      This probably results from something in the cleanup that I'm missing
      to perform correctly, but I don't know what it is at the moment, so
      this test will force AnyEvent to use AnyEvent::Impl::Perl.
      If you have any pointers, patches are certainly appreciated!

0.00012 - 25 Feb 2010
    * Fix for when set operations (include set, add, and the like)
      might cause the client to stall. This only happens if you are using
      the text protocol.
    * Also, the paramter passed to these callbacks were bogus. That's been
      fixed too
